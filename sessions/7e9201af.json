  "user_prompt": "I want you build an application just like replit.com, build layout and every feature and user journey. Replit-style product spec (for replication): User journey + features + layout + functionality \u2014 Entry points: landing page with clear CTAs (\u201cCreate App\u201d, \u201cUse AI Agent\u201d, \u201cImport from GitHub\u201d), plus auth (email/OAuth) and a lightweight onboarding that asks goal (Build with AI / Start from template / Import repo) and stack preference. After onboarding, user lands on Dashboard: left sidebar (Home, Projects, Templates, Deployments, AI Agent, Teams/Collaborators, Settings/Billing), main area showing recent projects with \u201cRun\u201d, \u201cOpen\u201d, \u201cDeploy\u201d, \u201cShare\u201d, search bar (project name/tag), and a \u201cNew App\u201d button. New App flow: modal with tabs (AI Prompt, Templates, Import Repo). AI Prompt flow: a prompt box with examples, optional toggles (web app vs script, language/framework, database yes/no, auth yes/no), then \u201cBuild\u201d which creates a new Project and opens Workspace with an Agent panel running steps (plan \u2192 scaffold \u2192 install deps \u2192 run \u2192 fix errors). Template flow: cards (Node/Express, Python/Flask, React, Next.js, Java, Go, etc.), \u201cCreate\u201d generates repo structure and opens Workspace. Import flow: connect Git provider, select repo/branch, set run command and environment, then open Workspace. Workspace layout (core): three-pane web IDE with top bar + side bar; Top bar: project name, branch/status, \u201cRun/Stop\u201d button, \u201cDeploy\u201d button, \u201cShare\u201d button, environment indicator (Dev), and a quick-command palette. Left rail: file explorer (tree), search, git, packages/dependencies, deployments, secrets, logs. Center: code editor tabs with syntax highlighting, breadcrumbs, split view, inline diagnostics, and file actions (new/rename/delete). Bottom panel: terminal + problems/output tabs; terminal supports multiple sessions, command history, and clickable links. Right panel: AI Agent chat + actions timeline; shows plan, current step, files changed (diff viewer), and buttons (Apply changes, Undo/Restore checkpoint, Run tests, Ask to explain). Preview/Output: either a right-side \u201cPreview\u201d tab or a separate panel that shows the running web app with refresh and open-in-new-tab. Core functionality: one-click Run executes configured run command, streams logs to console, starts a web server and exposes a stable preview URL; auto-detect framework ports and show health status. Agent functionality: agent can read/write files, install packages, run commands, start/stop app, debug based on errors, and iteratively improve; must be constrained by permissions (no destructive ops without confirmation), always present diffs before applying, keep checkpoints, and support rollback. Collaboration: \u201cShare\u201d generates a link with permission levels (view/comment/edit), shows presence (avatars, cursors), and provides real-time co-editing with conflict resolution; include chat/comments or lightweight activity feed. Secrets: dedicated Secrets UI (key/value), values masked, stored encrypted, injected as env vars in run/deploy; include environment scoping (dev vs prod) and audit log (created/edited by). Deployments: Deploy button opens a deploy wizard with deployment types (Static, Autoscale, Always-on VM), recommended choice based on project type, configuration (build command, start command, port, region), env vars (prod secrets), custom domain (DNS instructions + TLS auto), and cost estimate; after deploy, show deployment dashboard with status, versions, logs, metrics (requests, CPU/mem), scale settings, and rollback to prior version. Project settings: configure run command, build command, language/runtime version, dependencies, exposed ports, background jobs, and storage (persistent volume). Git: integrated commit/push/pull UI, branch switcher, diff viewer, merge conflict helper, optional auto-commit checkpoints for agent edits. Error handling UX: if Run fails, show prominent error banner with \u201cAsk Agent to Fix\u201d, highlight stack trace, link to offending file/line, and provide guided fixes. Sharing outputs: every project has a public/private toggle and a shareable \u201clive demo\u201d link (for deployed apps) plus a \u201cworkspace share\u201d link (for collaboration). Mobile-friendly minimum: dashboard browsing + viewing logs + agent chat, but full coding may be desktop-first. Replication guardrails: never expose secrets in logs/chat; rate-limit agent actions; require confirmation for deletes/migrations; always maintain restore points; show explicit state (Running/Stopped/Deploying/Deployed) and keep UI fast with optimistic updates and background streaming logs. ****** i want you check the screenshot i provided.. it must be pixle to pixle mirror what I have in screensot*****",
