Here's a concise summary of the coding session:

## Session Summary: Test Task

**1. TASK SUMMARY**
The session was dedicated to a generic "Test task".

**2. ACTIONS TAKEN**
*   **PA Decisions:** No specific PA decisions were recorded during this session.
*   **Claude Actions:** Claude produced two distinct outputs (Output 1 and Output 2), likely in response to the task or intermediate steps.

**3. FILES MODIFIED**
*   `file1.py`: Modified. (Reason for modification not detailed in provided logs.)
*   `file2.py`: Modified. (Reason for modification not detailed in provided logs.)

**4. CURRENT STATE**
The "Test task" is in progress. Files `file1.py` and `file2.py` have been modified, and Claude has generated two outputs. The specific status of the task (e.g., awaiting review, further implementation) is not explicitly stated.

**5. NEXT STEPS**
To resume, the next steps should involve:
*   Reviewing Claude's outputs (Output 1 and Output 2) to understand their content and relevance to the task.
*   Examining the changes made to `file1.py` and `file2.py` to verify their correctness and purpose.
*   Determining the next phase of the "Test task" based on the current state and the results of the review.
